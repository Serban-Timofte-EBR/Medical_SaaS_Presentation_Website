This was followed by a transition to targeted therapy in mid-2023, specifically aimed at HER2-positive cells, leveraging advances in precision medicine. The targeted therapy has been crucial in reducing tumor size while minimizing systemic side effects. The patient continues to respond well, with regular monitoring through PET-CT scans showing a significant reduction in tumor markers."

The tumor mass shrunk by approximately 30%, and the patient reported increased energy levels and reduced pain. The oncologist also noted a slight alteration in the patient's blood panel, indicating potential side effects, which were managed with supportive medications. The patient's psychosocial well-being was also addressed, with the doctor encouraging further engagement with support groups."

The oncologist decided to reduce the chemotherapy dosage while introducing a complementary immunotherapy regimen aimed at boosting the patientâ€™s immune response to residual cancer cells. This change was primarily driven by improved test results, showing a 45% reduction in tumor volume, alongside stable biomarkers indicating minimal systemic stress from previous treatments. The switch to immunotherapy aims to sustain the progress made while preparing for long-term remission."
